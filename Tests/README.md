# Libftest - Testing

Libftest contains script to test libft project. The script will perform the following tests:

- Check if libft.h exists
- Check norme of libft.h
- Check if the Makefile file exists
- Check rules in Makefile
- Check compilation's flags in Makefile
- Compile the library
- Check norme errors
- Check forbidden functions
- Testing functions

At the end of the tests, a `deepthought` file will be created, inside which you can find traces of all the results and error/failure messages. You can also see your results and the expected results in `tests` directory.

The script will compile your files with your libft, so you must have your Makefile up to date.

⚠️ **All the tests made are not the official tests** ⚠️
